# Code for simulations after learning to generate output for phasic and tonic response to step input

## How to run

On the terminal, execute the file run.sh -> $bash run.sh

Or change the file to executable -> $chmod +x run.sh

and then run it directly -> $./run.sh

It will ask which simulation you would like to run, press 1, 2, or 3 according to your choice.

1 -> Co-tuned only from Hebbian

2 -> Co-tuned from Hebbian + flat from scaling

3 -> Co-tuned from Hebbian + counter-tuned from anti-Hebbian

It will take approximately 30 minutes to run ~80 minutes of simulation time (more or less depending on your processor). 
It consists of n_trials for each pathway, with uniformly random step input between 0-50Hz, and for 3 cases. 

## Output

Data is generated in the folder spiking_data, and the experimental condition as the subdirectory name. The naming of output files is in the form {seed0}_{n_trials}.

## Folders

Source data is pulled from the weights generated by the learning simulations. To run step_input simulations, you must have run learning first, as it relies on these weight matrices as input.

## Parameters

Parameters for models are in "config.f90" file, in the vector "pr" and other specific variable names. 

## Initial conditions.

Initial conditions are in file "initial_conditions.f90" and "initial_conditions2.f90".
